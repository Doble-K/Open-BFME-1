* When hand-declaring a class just to carry a naked body's decorated name, the access specifier is part of the name: MSVC encodes public as Q, protected as I and private as A in the third character (`??0X@@QAE@XZ` vs `??0X@@IAE@XZ`). Declaring DisconnectManager's constructor under `protected:` produced ??0DisconnectManager@@IAE@XZ and the build failed with "symbol not found in object" rather than a byte mismatch, which is the tell. Match the reference header's section, not just the signature.

* A byte-exact function needs every call site to resolve, so a big function's
  cost is set by its least-known callee, not by its size. GameEngine::init is
  7123 bytes with 165 distinct call targets: 92 are named, 73 are not. Of those
  73, sixteen are the 154-byte initSubsystem bodies that cannot be claimed until
  their T is proven, and only seven reference a string that could anchor a name
  -- the other fifty have no evidence attached to them at all. So init is not
  blocked on effort or on codegen, it is blocked on roughly fifty independent
  naming problems, and counting them is cheaper than discovering them one
  mismatch at a time. Run the same count before committing to any large
  function: for each call, deref the thunk chain and check functions.csv plus
  symbols.csv. Applied to the 96 INI block parsers the same count sorts them
  into four with no blockers, eleven with exactly one, and the rest with two or
  more, which is a work queue rather than a list.

* A MASM dump byte-matches at any length you give it, because it is the retail
  bytes. That makes an over-long dump row invisible to the verifier in a way an
  over-long C++ row is not: ?parse@DataChunkInput@@QAE_NPAX@Z claimed 1006 bytes
  where the function is 231, ran past its ret 0x10 and the int3 padding after it,
  and silently swallowed three later functions -- one of which, LocalFile's
  constructor, then could not be claimed because its address was already inside
  somebody else's range. tools/audit_short_rows.py looks for the opposite
  mistake. Check a dump row's size against a real disassembly before trusting
  it, especially when a claim inside its range mysteriously will not land.
