"""Pin-consistency guard for reverse/symbols.csv.

symbols.csv is an ADDITIVE candidate list. build.py's REL32 resolver walks a
name's addresses in file order and keeps the first displacement that reproduces
retail (see load_symbol_map / compile_function). Give one name enough addresses
and something will match, so a green gate proves the BYTES of the caller and
says nothing about WHICH function the callee is. Three misidentifications
reached master through exactly that hole:

  * findNonConstCommandButton was pinned at both 0x36D27 and 0x44EEF, whose
    thunks follow to different 126-byte bodies. A shim had moved two struct
    fields so one class would fit the wrong one; the result byte-matched and was
    written up as an exact match (retracted in a16b62ec9).
  * 0x14867 is currently pinned as winSetDisabledColor, winSetEnabledColor,
    winSetEnabledBorderColor AND winSetHiliteColor at once, which is how sixteen
    GameWindow/GadgetSlider rows came to sit one body early (ba1dbf6f8).

THE INVARIANT: every address pinned to one name must, after following the
incremental-link thunk chain, land on a body byte-equal to every other body the
same name pins. One name, one function.

HOW TEMPLATES ARE HANDLED (explicitly, not by exclusion)
--------------------------------------------------------
A template instantiated in K translation units leaves up to K byte-identical
COMDATs in retail, and pinning all K is legitimate -- those are the same
function. Two copies of one function at different RVAs differ ONLY in their
rel32 displacement slots, and there by exactly (rva_b - rva_a), because a
displacement is `target - (site + 4)` and the target is shared. So the
comparison rebases instead of excluding: bytes must be equal everywhere except
at rel32 slots anchored to a real branch opcode (E8/E9/0F 8x), where the two
little-endian displacements must differ by exactly the RVA delta.

That is strictly stronger than the blind masking compile_function does for a
lib member: blind masking would let two DIFFERENT call targets pass, the
rebasing test would not. No name pattern is consulted anywhere -- a `??$`
template and a hand-written function are judged by the same rule, and a folded
(ICF) body reached from two pins is one body and trivially consistent.

BASELINE, NOT WHITELIST
-----------------------
First run found a backlog of known-bad pins. reverse/pin_consistency_baseline.csv
records each one WITH its evidence so the guard fails on anything NEW while the
backlog is drained. It is deliberately not self-seeding: an absent baseline is a
hard failure with instructions, never an auto-written free pass, because
verify_dir32_consistency's self-bootstrap is how 18 whitelist entries (8 of them
provably-wrong placements) got written without a human ever reading them.

The key is (symbol, sorted body RVAs). Adding or removing a pin changes the key,
so a baselined symbol cannot quietly absorb a new bad address, and a FIXED
symbol leaves a stale line that also fails -- the fix and the line removal are
one commit. Shrinking this file is the only direction it is allowed to move.
