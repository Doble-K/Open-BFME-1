// cl: /DNDEBUG /MD /GX /Od /GZ /GS
// Three small /Od /GZ bodies from the 0x007EBAE0..0x007EC780 span, sharing this
// file because they share a compiler line and a subject: bounded string work
// against a caller's buffer.  Nothing in them names a module -- no string and no
// selector is reachable -- so the file name and every function name here are
// derived from addresses.

// 0x007EBAE0 is a GET-AND-SET on a single byte of global state: it saves the old
// value, stores the new one, and returns what was there.  A caller can therefore
// restore it, which is what makes this a scoped override rather than a setter.
// The old value goes through a one-byte local rather than staying in a register,
// which is why the frame exists at all.

// 0x007EC280 IS A BOUNDED COPY THAT REPORTS WHAT IT WROTE.  The counter starts
// at the caller's size and is spent per byte, so the return -- size minus what
// is left -- is the number of bytes copied, terminator included.
//
// THE SOURCE TEST IS PART OF THE LOOP CONDITION, not a break: retail leaves the
// loop with a single `je` at that test, which is what a second `&&` operand
// compiles to; a break inside the body is `jne` over a `jmp` and moves every
// displacement after it.
//
// The bound is `> 1`, so one byte is always held back, and the terminator is
// then written only when the counter is still positive -- which it always is
// after that loop.  A size of zero skips the loop and the terminator both, and
// returns zero.

// 0x007EC730 WRITES A TAG AND ITS SEPARATOR.  It copies the source up to its

//
// IT IS UNBOUNDED.  There is no count and no limit: the only thing that stops
// the copy is the source's own terminator, and the caller's buffer is not
// consulted.  That is what the separate first argument is for -- given a null
// source, this writes a terminator through THAT pointer and returns the
// destination untouched, which is the only way it reports anything at all.
